- 👋 Hi, I’m @PraveenSinghKshatri
- 👀 I’m interested in User Experience (UX) design and the seamless integration of design with technology. I love creating intuitive interfaces and exploring how design can enhance functionality.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Full Stack development through The Odin Project. I’m keen on expanding my skills to include both frontend and backend development, and integrating this knowledge with my UX design expertise.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that involve UX design and full-stack development. If you’re working on a project where design and technical implementation intersect, I’d love to collaborate!
- 📫 Connect with me via email at singh.praveen1431@outlook.com. I’m excited to discuss potential collaborations and share ideas!
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: To dive into UX design, I created a mock website for a fictional company from scratch. It was like a playground for experimenting with design principles, and I was amazed at how even the smallest tweaks could transform the user experience in unexpected ways!
